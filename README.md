Pgm1: Implement 3 nodes point to point network with duplex links between them. Set the queue size, vary the bandwidth and find the number of packets dropped.

Pgm2: Implement transmission of ping messages/trace route over a network topology consisting of 6 nodes and find the number of packets dropped due to congestion.

Pgm3: To Create scenario and study the performance of token ring protocols through simulation(Using Ring topology).

Pgm4: To Create scenario and study the performance of token ring protocols through simulation(Using Star Topology).

Pgm5: To create scenario & study the performance of token bus protocol through simulator(Bus topology).

Pgm6: Implement an Ethernet LAN using n nodes and set multiple traffic nodes and plot congestion window for different source/destination.

Pgm7: To simulate and study stop and wait protocol.

Pgm8: To Simulate and study of Go Back N Protocol.
